Your initial capital is \\$ 1000. The interest rate r is 0.5% per month and does not change. The initial stock price is \\$ 100. Your stochastic model for the stock price is as follows: next month the price is the same as this month with probability 1/2, with probability 1/4 it is 5% lower, and with probability 1/4 it is 5% higher. This principle applies for every new month. There are no transaction costs when you buy or sell stock. Your investment strategy for the next 5 years is: convert all your money to stock when the price drops below \\$ 95, and sell all stock and put the money in the bank when the stock price exceeds \\$ 110. Describe how to simulate the results of this strategy for the model given.\n","Note: You will have to generate 60 random variables with distribution U(0,1) to answer\n","this question.
